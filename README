PHP-REPL

A simple REPL for PHP written in PHP.

==Description==

Developed & tested with PHP 5.3 under Linux.

Works best with BASH and rlwrap.

Advantages over other PHP REPLs:
- Written in PHP, so no other requirements to run it, and no other skills needed to hack it.
- Doesn't require PHP to be compiled with readline
- Works with everything your PHP supports, e.g., auto-loaded classes.

Inspired by http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.interactive.php#98642

==Installation==

Not required, but if you're running under BASH, you can run `sudo ./install.sh` to install globally for all users.

==Usage==
If you have BASH, just run `phprepl` for the fully featured version.

Otherwise, you can run `php /path/to/phprepl.php`.

Tips:
- The semi-colon is option for one-line commands.
- You can run a function that doesn't require arguments with just the function name, e.g. 'phpinfo'.
- Tab completion of previously used commands is available if you have rlwrap.
- Just type $var to get print_r($var)
- The last output variable/return is available as $out. So don't use that variable name yourself in the global scope if you value your sanity.
- Input code is not validated. It's really easy to crash this shell.
- Type CTRL-c to quit.


===Drupal Users===
If you have Drush, you can run `drepl` from a Drupal directory to get a PHP REPL with Drupal fully bootstrapped for you.

Or if installed in a drush commands directory, you can run `drush repl`. (History and Tab Completion not yet implemented via this command.)
